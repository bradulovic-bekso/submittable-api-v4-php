/**
 * Submittable API Documentation
 *
 * This page contains the documentation on how to use Submittable through API calls.  ### Breaking changes   * All v3/requests and v3/responses endpoints merged into v4/entries endpoints     * Entries are a combination of both the request and response from v3 * All endpoints returning a page now use a continuation token instead of page number and page size     * Endpoints no longer return a count of how many items there are     * Endpoints no longer return how many pages there are     * Filters and size are made on the first request only, subsequent requests can only use the continuation token returned on the response. * Get a submission now returns formEntries instead of formResponses     * formEntries does not contain the fieldData property         * To get a single entry use the \"Get an entry\" endpoint, /v4/entries/{entryId}         * To get all entries for a submission use the \"Get a submission’s entries\" endpoint, /v4/entries/submissions/{submissionId} * All submissionId properties are now guids instead of integers * All labelId properties are now guids instead of integers * LegacyProjects.Include and LegacyProjects.Exclude on /v3/submissions have been removed * Update project endpoint /v3/projects/{projectId} now updates everything for a project * v3/projects/stages endpoints are removed, now review stages are managed by the create and update project endpoints * Get a list of team members and their assignment counts /v3/organizations/team/assignments has been replaced by /v4/organizations/team to get team members and /v4/submissions/team/assignment to get their assignment counts   ### Authentication  To access the API, you must present an API Key provisioned for your organization.  The API Key is sent using a basic authentication header, with the API key as the username and a blank password. Please ensure that the value is formatted as `{apiKey}`.  ``` Authorization: Basic {apiKey} ```  ### Request Content Type  All endpoints, unless otherwise noted, accept and produce `application/json`. Please ensure the `Content-Type` header for POST and PUT requests are set correctly.
